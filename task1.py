interest = principal * rate * #days in the month / 365

Ask the user to enter the amount of their principal, the number of days in the month the rate of interest expressed as a percentage.  Calculate the amount of interest they would be paid.

example:
Enter your amount: 100
Enter the rate: 2.5
Enter the # of days in the month: 30
You earned $0.2 interest.
